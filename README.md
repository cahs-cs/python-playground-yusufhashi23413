# Welcome to Your Coding Playground

This repository is set up for you to practice coding, using GitHub and Codespaces. It will help you manage your projects and assignments as you go through the class. Here’s how to get started.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform that allows you to store and manage code online. You can also collaborate with others on coding projects.

**Key Terms:**
- **Repository (Repo)**: A place to store code.
- **Commit**: Saving your changes to the repository.
- **Push**: Uploading your commits from your local computer or Codespace to GitHub.

## What is GitHub Codespaces?

Codespaces is an online development environment. This means you can write, run, and test your code without needing to install any software on your computer. Everything runs in the cloud.

### Getting Started with GitHub Codespaces

1. Click the **Codespaces** tab in your repository.
2. Click **Create Codespace on Main**. This will start an online coding environment where you can work on your code.

### Running Your First Program

1. Navigate to the `/assignments/hello_world/` folder.
2. Open the `main.py` file.
3. Inside `main.py`, write the following code:
    ```python
    print("Hello World!")
    ```
4. Press **Run** to see your code in action.

### How to Save and Commit Your Work

1. After you've written your code, click on the **Source Control** tab on the left side of the Codespace.
2. You’ll see a list of changes. Write a short message in the box describing what you did (this is called a **commit message**), for example: `"Added hello world script"`.
3. Click **Commit** to save these changes.
4. To upload (or **push**) your changes to GitHub, click on the three dots `...` next to the commit button and select **Push**. This will send your changes to the repository on GitHub.

Congratulations! You've now written, committed, and pushed your first piece of code!

## How to Work on Future Assignments

1. As new assignments are posted, create a new folder under `/assignments/` to organize your work.
   Example: `/assignments/project_name/`
2. Write your code inside the folder, and remember to commit and push your work as you go.
3. Keep exploring Codespaces and using GitHub to manage your projects!

Feel free to experiment and make this repository your coding playground. You will be expanding this repo as we continue with new projects.

Happy coding!
